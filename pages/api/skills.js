      'You need to find new clients for your network marketing business every day. Anyone can become a successful network marketing business person. Never underrate any person. It is known and documented that some of the most successful and richest distributors began extremely poor and penniless. They came into the office in sleepers, hungry,and poorly dressed. Today they are high flying millionaires. So, everybody is a potential client. Give them a chance. Talk to everyone who is willing to listen to you.',

      'Once you have identified a potential client, you need to talk to them, thus inviting (him or her) to a meeting. Knowing how to ask and schedule a business meeting is an important skill. You don’t want to have prospects saying no to the meeting. You need at least 7 out of 10 to say yes.',

    title: 'Follow up',
    description:
      'Most prospects will not buy your agcera business idea on the first presentation. Most new clients buy 3 months after the first meeting. That is the reason you have to make prospect follow up efforts. If you do one follow up in a month, by the 3rd month, the prospect will most likely sign up. Follow up helps you create a friendship with a potential client. People buy from people they know, their friends. So, become a friend first, then sell your business idea.',

    title: 'Closing',
    description:
      'Communicate the benefits, rewards, advantages, and reasons why agcera is the best business option for your prospect. Show testimonials and proof your case with examples of those who have made it. Do not lie, tell the truth. Ask the prospect for the registration fee. Yes, you need to close the deal by asking for the money now.',

      ' You need to train, encourage, and support your new down line until they are able to do it on their own. Ask them to attend company training classes every day at least for the first week.',

    title: 'Feedback ',
    description:
      ' Rejection is simply feedback. It is never personal. Once you understand that, you can sell anything to anyone. Rejection is adequately supplied in network marketing. 7 out of 10 prospects will reject your network marketing business idea. They don’t reject you, they reject what you are selling to them. You have to learn to live with rejection in this business. You should never give up due to rejection. The 1st ten prospect may not buy but the 11th prospect will surely buy. So, take heart and move on to the next prospect. That is what we do to succeed in network marketing.',

    description:
      ' The business world is changing all the time. As a network marketer with ag nutrition you need to change with the times otherwise you will be left behind. Attend learning classes provided by the company regularly to learn new ways of doing business. Attend training sessions to learn, understand, and have first-hand information on new products and how to market them. Take care of your grooming. It is a good idea to look presentable through modern dressing styles. Look like a 21st-century network marketing business person. You need to be the role model of success in this business to attract new business partners (i.e., your down line.) Read books written by successful network marketers in order to pick their brains and their success tips, secrets, and strategies. Watch YouTube videos on network marketing to stay informed about your career. Listen to the latest improvements and ideas that make this industry tick. And don’t forget the motivational videos from leading and inspiring motivational speakers for encouragement.',
